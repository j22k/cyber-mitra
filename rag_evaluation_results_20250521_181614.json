If the portal fails to do so and you suffer a loss as a result, they may be held liable (Refer to Page 18, Section 43A of the IT Act).\n\nThe fraudulent SMS asking for your card details is an attempt at phishing \u2013 a method used to trick individuals into revealing sensitive information. Phishing is often associated with cyber crimes and can fall under Section 66 of the Information Technology Act, 2000 (Refer to Page 37).\n\nThe individual who sent the fraudulent SMS is attempting to commit an offence by misusing your stolen data. They can be prosecuted under Section 316 of the Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita (BNS) for cheating, as they are dishonestly inducing you to deliver your property \u2013 your credit card details (Refer to Page 204).\n\nTo protect yourself, you should:\n1. Immediately report the breach and the fraudulent SMS to the online shopping portal.\n2. Block your credit card if it has not been done already.\n3.

Relevant sections of the Indian Penal Code related to criminal intimidation may also apply, depending on the nature of the threats.\n\nIt is recommended that you immediately report this incident to your local police station or the Cyber Crime Cell (cybercrime.gov.in). When filing a First Information Report (FIR), explain the situation and provide any evidence you have collected, such as screenshots of the messages, profile URLs, and email headers if applicable. Do not delete the messages immediately, as they may serve as important evidence in your case.\n\nIn the Suhas Katti case, similar actions were successfully prosecuted under these laws, so it is advisable to seek legal assistance and take appropriate action to protect yourself from further harm.",

This Act protects your intellectual property rights as the creator.

To address this, you should send a formal legal notice (cease and desist letter) to the travel agency, gather clear evidence of the infringement (screenshots of their site/posts, links), and consider filing a civil lawsuit for injunction and damages under the Copyright Act.

      "rag_answer": " In this scenario, the unauthorized use of your original photographs by a travel agency is likely an infringement of copyright. Copyright law in India is primarily governed by the Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita (BNS), specifically Section 52(1)(i) and (ia). These sections provide exceptions to infringement, but they only apply if the use of your work falls under certain criteria such as fair dealing or if the user has obtained a license.\n\nSince the travel agency did not obtain your permission to use your photographs, it is possible that they have violated your copyright. To protect your rights and seek remedies, you can take the following steps:\n\n1. Cease and Desist Letter: Write a letter to the travel agency requesting them to immediately stop using your photographs, and if already used, remove them from their website and social media platforms. Include a clear statement that they are infringing on your copyright, along with your contact details and legal representation (if any).\n\n2. Copyright Notice: Add a copyright notice to the original photographs you uploaded on your website. A typical notice would include your name, the year of creation, and the phrase \"All Rights Reserved.\" This serves as a reminder that the work is protected by copyright law.\n\n3. Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA) Notice: Since the unauthorized use took place online, you can send a DMCA takedown notice to the travel agency or their web hosting provider, requesting them to remove the infringing content. In India, there is no direct equivalent to the DMCA, but some website hosts may honor such notices voluntarily.\n\n4. Small Claims Court: If the financial damages caused by the infringement are within your jurisdiction's small claims court limit, you can file a lawsuit seeking monetary compensation for the unauthorized use of your work. In case the damage exceeds the small claim limits, you may consider filing a regular civil suit.\n\n5. Police Complaint: In some cases where the infringement is part of a larger scheme, such as identity theft or cybercrime, you can file an FIR with the local police or report to the Cyber Crime Cell.\n\n6. Legal Representation: If the case becomes complex or requires extensive legal knowledge, consider hiring a copyright attorney to help navigate the process and protect your rights effectively.",
